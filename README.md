# Capstone, Stage 2: Build

## Time Matters 

Time flies, it goes away unnoticed and at the end of the day you wonder what you have spent it on. Was it worth it? This app can answer you this recurrent question.

This app allows to manage  and record the time spent on any of the following activities:

* Fitness
* Study
* Hobbies
* Work

For each activity you can create your own tasks and categories. Attached to a category it is possible to set up an icon and the default values for the following properties:

* Time duration
* Switch to generate a notification when the time is completed
* Color
 
A task will have a category and the properties inherited from the category which can be overridden at any time. 

On the activity detail screen, the actual task in progress will be shown followed by the report of tasks completed. The task in progress will have more room on the screen and it will be more detailed. The completed tasks can be rated with stars if the activity has this feature enabled. By default  the report will show only the actual day tasks but it can be switched to last 7 or 30 days.

An activity can be linked to a timetable or a location. When the App starts if there is only one activity that matches the actual time and/or location the first screen shown will be the detail for this activity. If there is more than one that matches or there is none, the first screen will be the activity list, in this case the user will have to pick the activity to work with.
